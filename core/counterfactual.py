"""Mechanical counterfactual ledger: the trades Phil's gates declined.

PROTECTED CORE - the trading agent must not edit files under core/.

journal/forecasts.jsonl records a belief (est_prob) and the book at record
time for every researched market, including the ones a gate declined
(skip_reason != "bet"). Nothing in that record says what those declines
cost or saved. This tool answers that mechanically, once, for every settled
declined row, so the answer stops depending on a table re-summed by hand.

`ledger` builds the counterfactual trade each declined row implies:

  side   the sign of est_prob - market_prob_at_record (the model's own
         disagreement with the market; no threshold, no policy)
  stake  flat $5
  fill   replay.fill, so the protected caps and the honest CLOB fill model
         (Yes at the recorded ask, No at 1 - recorded bid) apply unchanged
  edge   the realizable, fill-price edge the hand table uses:
         Yes: est_prob - best_ask;  No: best_bid - est_prob

Two frames, kept apart on purpose. est_prob, the book and replay.fill all
refer to the RECORDED OUTCOME TOKEN, which on some rows is the market's
"No" token; the playbook's table and every reported side split
speak in question frame, where "yes" means the model bet the question
resolves Yes (or that the named outcome happens). Rows carry both: `side`
and `price` are token-frame, as fill() needs them; `market_side` and
`market_outcome` are question-frame, and are what the splits and the
reconcile diff use. Conflating the two silently flips the side and the
result on every No-token row.

A row replay.fill refuses (entry outside the protected price band, banned
question pattern, too close to resolution, no book on the traded side) is
listed with its refusal rather than dropped, because a gate that only ever
declined unfillable rows saved nothing.

Universe: every SETTLED row with skip_reason != "bet". This is wider than
replay.load_rows(), deliberately: that helper drops superseded rows and
rows with no ask, while the hand-kept playbook table grades a row on its
ORIGINAL record-time book even when a later belief superseded it (its BoK
convention). Superseded rows are counted and flagged, never hidden.

Splits: by skip_reason, by side, by category, and by the playbook's named
sub-classes (narrative, trend-extrapolation, countable-metric,
fact-finality, same-day weather), attached when the row's own note or the
retro prose written around that row's id names one. Rows nothing names are
reported as (unlabelled), with the count.

Each split reports n, W/L, pnl, brier_delta and the walk-forward read: the
group's rows cut into K contiguous time folds exactly as replay.py cuts
them, with the counterfactual pnl landing in each fold. A total carried by
one late cluster of wins shows up as one fat fold, not as a verdict.
brier_delta = mean Brier(est_prob) - mean Brier(market at record) over the
declined rows: a gate skipping rows whose beliefs BEAT the market
(negative) is a different problem from one skipping rows whose beliefs
lose to it (positive), and the pnl column alone cannot tell them apart.

`reconcile` diffs that mechanical ledger against the hand-kept table under
"Outside-view veto: settled counterfactual ledger" in the frozen
strategy/playbook-reference.md
(markdown rows plus the batches written up in prose only). Rows are matched
by forecast id where the playbook names one, else by question text and
date. It prints hand rows with no ledger row, settled outside-view-veto
ledger rows the hand table never entered, matched rows whose side, edge,
result or pnl disagree, both totals and the difference. It does not correct
the playbook; the diff is the output.

The hand table stakes 1u per row, this ledger stakes $5, so reconcile
compares pnl in units (ledger pnl / 5).
