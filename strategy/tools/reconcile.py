"""Funnel <-> forecast coverage checker — AGENT-EDITABLE (strategy/tools/).

Added by DEEP-2026-08-21 after the coverage weld (playbook, Funnel
instrumentation) was violated twice on its first day in force: the
2026-08-20 14:27Z and 18:17Z FULL cycles recorded 4 forecasts
(e5d0e44532c3, 9a1c771fd651, 371aa91ed8bc, 84e1b257aa68) with no funnel
line — the fourth and fifth funnel-coverage defects in five windows.
DEEP-2026-08-20 declared the next recurrence a compliance pattern; this is
the escalation: a mechanical check instead of more prose.

Checks, over a trailing window (default 24h):
  1. Every forecasts.jsonl row's id appears in some funnel.jsonl
     `researched[].forecast_id` (substring match — funnel entries may
     annotate the id, e.g. "df7062f3e89d (existing, unchanged)").
  2. Every funnel `researched` entry with an estimate-bearing skip reason
     (no-edge, market-agrees, outside-view-veto, category-bar,
     wide-spread-veto, bet) carries a forecast_id.
  3. Every FULL-cycle funnel line (tick_type absent or "FULL") carries
     `pool_by_query` (non-empty object) and `pool_total` (number) — the
     mandatory-fields rule (playbook, Funnel instrumentation /
     DEEP-2026-08-18). Added DEEP-2026-08-24 after the prose rule was
     violated twice in two days post-flagging (2026-08-23 00:11Z and
     2026-08-24 03:11Z lines both omitted pool_total, the second one the
     AfD bet cycle); same escalation shape as this tool's own origin: a
     mechanical check instead of more prose. TRIGGERED-cycle lines are
     exempt (fixed 2026-08-25T02:53Z, false-positive on the 3rd straight
     TRIGGERED-cycle line): CYCLE.md's TRIGGERED tick skips step 4's
     broad scan by design, so those lines structurally have no pool to
     report — flagging them as gaps trained nothing, it just repeated a
     known-expected omission every trigger. Lines carrying a "backfill"
     field are exempt too (added 2026-09-13): the DEEP-2026-09-13 rule
     backfilled 7 FULL cycles from cycles.log prose, which only ever kept
     the pool TOTAL, never the per-query breakdown — pool_by_query is
     genuinely unrecoverable on those rows and already says so in the
     "backfill" field; re-flagging a documented-unrepairable gap every
     day it sits inside the trailing window trains nothing, same
     reasoning as the TRIGGERED exemption above.
  5. Veto-settlement table duty (DEEP-2026-08-27): every settled
     (won/lost) forecasts.jsonl row with skip_reason outside-view-veto or
     wide-spread-veto and settled_ts >= 2026-08-23 (when DEEP-2026-08-23
     made the same-commit counterfactual-table extension a rule) must have
     its id appear somewhere in strategy/playbook.md, the frozen
     strategy/playbook-reference.md, or a journal/retros/*.md file (since
     DEEP-2026-09-30 the counterfactual grading lives in the retro). The prose rule was violated three
     times on 2026-08-26 alone (Crowley 7dac557c4c19 at 07:28Z, the three
     PCE MoM rows at 15:21Z, the BoK pair at 04:13Z next day — the last
     logged as "veto-correct" when the vetoed read had in fact WON its
     counterfactual), so it gets the same escalation as checks 1-4: a
     mechanical check instead of more prose. A mere id mention doesn't
     prove the arithmetic was done — deep retros still audit quality —
     but it makes silent omission impossible.
  6. FULL-cycle funnel-line presence (DEEP-2026-08-27): every cycles.log
     line in the window whose first marker is "(FULL cycle" must have a
     funnel.jsonl line whose cycle ts falls in the 45 minutes before the
     log ts. The 2026-08-26 09:24Z FULL ran a complete scan+screen+research
     pass, recorded zero forecasts, wrote NO funnel line — and that absence
     blinded checks 3 and 4 (its 99-minute pacing-pointer breach was
     invisible because check 4 reads funnel lines, not cycle logs). The
     operator mandate says every FULL appends a line, forecasts or not.
  4. Pacing-pointer freshness (DEEP-2026-08-26): the newest FULL-cycle
     funnel line in the window must not postdate schedule.json's
     `next_full_cycle_after` by more than 65 minutes. DEEP-2026-08-25
     flagged a FULL cycle that ran past a stale pointer without
     advancing it (prose flag, first instance, weld pre-committed on
     repeat); it then repeated six times in 12 hours (the 2026-08-25
     22:16Z through 2026-08-26 04:17Z FULLs all ran against the
     17:21Z-set 20:15Z pointer). Running FULL every tick stays legal —
     but only by consciously advancing the pointer (to ~now or the next
     boundary) each FULL, which is the contract: every FULL commit
     touches the field or inherits a pointer still in the future. The
     65-minute grace absorbs the single tick that legitimately fires
     just past the pointer.

Exit 0 with "OK" when all hold; exit 1 listing each problem otherwise.
Run before the commit of any FULL cycle that recorded a forecast — the
check is the weld; a FULL-cycle commit while this fails is a discipline
violation, not an oversight (playbook, Coverage weld).
